### Versioning
This pack is 1.16.x at it's oldest. I am **NOT** going to back-port any of these changes to any other versions
I will try my hardest to updates this pack, in its latest release at the time, on the day of the next version
### THERE WILL NOT BE A FORGE VERSION

### Building the mod
To build this mod in its dev version you need to follow some steps to compile it into the .jar Minecraft needs to use this mod.

#### Requirements
You will need to have a JDK 8 or greater installed on your computer to build my mod. An easy location to acquire one of these is on [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net)

#### Compiling
Find the place where you've cloned the repository and type in the address bar `cmd` to launch Command Prompt. In here you want to type `gradlew build`. If this is your first time building a mod on your computer, Gradle will take a bit longer to set itself up, but after that the mod will build, you will find the resulting `.jar` files in `build/gradle`. Once you have found the folder, you want to drag and drop `periodic-mod-fabric-X.X.X-SNAPSHOT.jar` into your mods directory and then you're good to go
